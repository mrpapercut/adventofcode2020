# Advent of Code 2020

This repo is a collection of my solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

The goal of Advent of Code is to provide small programming exercises that can be solved with any programming language. For extra challenge, I will attempt to solve the challenges with a different programming language for each one.

Each code sample should be run from this directory (./). How to run the code is included each day, setting up a correct environment is not described.

## [Day 1 - Report Repair (Javascript)](./day01/day1.md)
## [Day 2 - Password Philosophy (Perl)](./day02/day2.md)
## [Day 3 - Toboggan Trajectory (Fortran)](./day03/day3.md)
## [Day 4 - Passport Processing (Go)](./day04/day4.md)
