# Advent of Code 2020

This repo is a collection of my solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

The goal of Advent of Code is to provide small programming exercises that can be solved with any programming language. For extra challenge, I will attempt to solve the challenges with a different programming language for each one.
