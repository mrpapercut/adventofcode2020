# Advent of Code 2020

This repo is a write-up of my solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

The goal of Advent of Code is to provide small programming exercises that can be solved with any programming languages. For extra challenge, I will attempt to solve the challenges with a different programming language for each one.

## [Day 1 - Report Repair (Javascript)](./day1.md)
## [Day 2 - Password Philosophy (Perl)](./day2.md)
## [Day 3 - Toboggan Trajectory (Fortran)](./day3.md)
